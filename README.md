/* AirBnB Project: The Clone*/

In this project, we are making an AirBnB like system which entails front-end(client side) and Back-end (server-side) programming

There will be on the server side the program to collect, save and validate date
from the user
On the client side, we have the User interface, what the end user will be interacting with an where data will be entered
 We start with Python
	console.py. The console is the command interpreter that is interactive, it takes object and coverts them to JSON files for storages in a database. The entries are stored in such a way that uniqueness must be guaranteed, thus uuid is used.
	It executes like the Python REPl session and can be exited using the ctrD shortcut
	console is run by typing the command "python3 console.py" and an interactive shell pops up. commands can be entered and error messages printed for non-existent commands
	To exit one just need to execute the quit command
